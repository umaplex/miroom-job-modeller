# Tab 1

This high-level specification for a **Low-Fidelity (Lo-Fi) Wireframe** focuses on "Job Modeller" as an Intelligence Platform. The goal is to maximize the "Signal-to-Noise" ratio, ensuring the user understands they are getting business logic, not interview tips.

---

## **1\. Global Navigation & Brand Tone**

* **Logo:** Left-aligned. Text-based "JOB MODELLER" in a monospaced font to signal "data/intelligence."  
* **Links:** Research, Practice (Hidden/Grayed out), Pricing.  
* **CTA:** "Generate Dossier" (Solid button).  
* **Aesthetic:** Clean, structural, and "Executive." Use a 12-column grid.

---

## **2\. Hero Section: The Intelligence Input**

The hero isn't a carousel; it's a **Functional Dashboard**.

* **Left Column (6-cols):** \* **Headline:** "Context Over Content."  
  * **Sub-headline:** "Generic prep is for juniors. High-growth operators use Job Modeller to decode the economic levers and burning platforms that drive senior-level hiring."  
* **Right Column (6-cols):**  
  * **The Input Box:** A large, elevated input field with a placeholder: Paste Job URL or Company Domain (e.g., permitflow.com)...  
  * **The "Analyze" Button:** Positioned inside or adjacent to the input.  
  * **Micro-copy:** "No credit card required for standard research."

---

## **3\. The "Theatrical" Scanner (Simulated UI)**

Once the URL is entered, the Hero content fades slightly, and an overlay appears.

* **Component:** A dark-themed terminal window.  
* **Content:** Auto-typing text lines:  
  * \[LOAD\] Analyzing PermitFlow.com...  
  * \[DB\] Accessing Cached Series B Financial Model...  
  * \[RAG\] Synthesizing Founder Podcast (Aug 2025)...  
  * \[OK\] 5 Context Pillars Mapped.  
* **Result:** A "Success" checkmark that triggers a scroll to the next section.

---

## **4\. The 5-Pillar Framework Section**

This is where you vet the product logic for the user. It should be presented as a **System Map**.

* **Layout:** A 2x3 or 1x5 grid of cards.  
* **Card Design:**  
  * **Title:** (e.g., Economic Engine).  
  * **Level 1 (Visible):** "What the Job Description says." (Light gray text).  
  * **Level 2 (Modeller):** "The Strategic Reality." (Bold, high-contrast text).  
* **Interactive State:** On hover, the card flips or expands to show a "Sample Insight" from your "Blessed" cache.

---

## **5\. The "Series B Goldilocks" Cache**

Show the user that you have "Blessed" data for the exact types of companies they are targeting.

* **Heading:** "The Growth Intelligence Library."  
* **Element:** A horizontal scrolling marquee or a 4x2 grid of company cards (e.g., *Rippling, Maven, Vercel, PermitFlow*).  
* **Metadata per card:** \* Logo.  
  * Market Category (e.g., Construction Tech).  
  * Last Intelligence Refresh: 2 days ago.  
  * "View Pillar: Economic Engine" (Free preview link).

---

## **6\. The Practice Lab Teaser (Modular Section)**

This is the part you can toggle off for the soft launch, but it's built into the design.

* **Design:** A "Glassmorphism" effect (blurred/frosted glass) over a mock chat interface.  
* **Headline:** "Pressure-Test Your Alignment."  
* **Sub-text:** "Coming Soon: Practice with AI personas modeled after the company's specific DNA."  
* **Call to Action:** "Join Waitlist for Practice Lab."

---

## **7\. Pricing: The "Intelligence Unit" (IU) Model**

Use a 3-column pricing table that emphasizes **Units**, not just months.

| Sprint ($49) | Season Pass ($149) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **10 Intelligence Units** | **30 Intelligence Units** |
| Single-month access | 3-month access |
| All 5 Context Pillars | All 5 Pillars \+ Competitor Mapping |
| 20 Data Refreshes | Unlimited Data Refreshes |
| **Select Sprint** | **Best Value: Select Season** |

---

## **8\. Footer (B2B Seed)**

* **Standard Links:** Terms, Privacy, FAQ.  
* **Recruiter Hook:** "Hiring for a high-growth startup? Give your candidates the context they need to succeed. **Learn about Recruiter Seats.**"

---

### **Design Considerations for the Developer:**

1. **Skeleton Screens:** Use skeleton loaders for the "Blessed Dossiers" to make the site feel like it's pulling from a high-speed database.  
2. **Breadcrumbs:** On the dossier pages, use breadcrumbs like Intelligence / Series B / PermitFlow / Economic Engine to reinforce the "Strategic Archive" feel.  
3. **Typography:** Use a variable font like **Geist Mono** for data points and **Inter** for prose.

**Would you like me to create the specific "UI Copy" for the modal that pops up after the simulated scanner finishes?**

# Tab 2

To scale a product from $5k to $100k MRR, the visual language must do more than look "nice"—it must **reduce friction for the sale.** Since we are selling **Strategic Intelligence** to high-level operators (PMs, Staff Engineers), the design must communicate: *This is not a toy. This is professional-grade data.*

---

## **I. Visual Design Language: "The Executive Briefing"**

We want to move away from the "Bubbly SaaS" look (rounded buttons, pastel colors, friendly illustrations) and toward a **Sovereign/Analytical** aesthetic.

### **1\. Color Palette: "Deep Intelligence"**

* **Primary (Background):** Dark Slate / Charcoal (\#121417) – Dark mode by default. It signals "Deep Work" and reduces eye strain for power users.  
* **Accent (Action):** Cyber Gold (\#FFD700) or Electric Indigo (\#5D5DFF) – Used sparingly for "Intelligence" callouts and CTA buttons.  
* **Signal Colors:** \* Mint Green: For "Freshness" indicators (e.g., "Last Updated: 1hr ago").  
  * Muted Gray: For secondary text and "Standard" (Level 1\) insights.

### **2\. Typography: "The Analytical Pair"**

* **Headlines:** **Inter (Semi-Bold)** – Clean, neutral, and highly readable. It feels like a modern tech company (Vercel, Stripe).  
* **Data & Logs:** **JetBrains Mono or Geist Mono** – Use this for the "Scanner" logs and specific data points (e.g., revenue numbers, headcounts). This creates a mental link between "Modeller" and "Data Accuracy."

### **3\. Imagery & Icons: "Structural Logic"**

* **No Stock Photos:** Avoid photos of people smiling. Use **abstract geometric diagrams** that show "Systems Thinking."  
* **Iconography:** Thin-line (2px) icons. Use metaphors for "Uncovering" or "Mapping" (e.g., radar, topographic lines, architectural blueprints).

---

## **II. The Tone of Voice: "The Strategic Advisor"**

Our tone is **Authoritative, Direct, and Context-First.** We do not "encourage" the user; we "brief" the user.

### **1\. Key Tonal Shifts**

| From (Standard Prep Tools) | To (Job Modeller) |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Good luck on your interview\!" | "Alignment initialized for \[Company Name\]." |
| "Here are common questions." | "Uncovering the Primary Revenue Levers." |
| "Practice makes perfect." | "Stress-test your strategic mental model." |
| "Tips for candidates." | "Briefing for Senior Operators." |

### **2\. The "Scanner" Language**

The language used in the simulated scanner is the most important part of the landing page. It needs to feel **Agentic.**

* *Bad:* "Finding info about the company..."  
* *Good:* \> Synthesizing Founder’s Vision...  
* *Good:* \> Extracting Business Context from Q3 earnings...  
* *Good:* \> Mapping Organizational Gravity (Engineering-led)...

### **3\. Micro-Copy Principles**

* **Avoid Fluff:** Never use words like "amazing," "best," or "powerful." Let the data do the talking.  
* **Focus on 'The Gap':** Use language that reminds the user they don't know everything yet. (e.g., *"There is a gap between the JD and the Boardroom. We bridge it."*)

---

## **III. The 5-Pillar Visual Structure**

To help users visualize the product logic, we present the **Context Framework** as an architectural map.

### **Copywriting for the Pillars:**

1. **Economic Engine:** *"Stop describing the product. Start describing the profit."*  
2. **Org DNA:** *"Identify the real power centers. Don't pitch engineering to a sales-led culture."*  
3. **The Burning Platform:** *"What is the $100M problem they need you to solve immediately?"*  
4. **Domain Lexicon:** *"Speak the tribal language of the leadership team. Sound like an insider on Day 0."*  
5. **Decision-Making Framework:** *"Understand how they prioritize risk vs. speed so you can frame your experience correctly."*

---

## **IV. Design Implementation Specs**

* **Border Radius:** Low (4px \- 6px). We want "Sharp" corners to feel more "Professional/Industrial."  
* **Animations:** Fast and functional. Use **"reveal"** animations (sliding up) rather than "bouncy" ones.  
* **Empty States:** When a user hasn't analyzed a company yet, show a **"Redacted"** style document layout to trigger curiosity.

Next Step:

Would you like me to create a Framer-ready layout guide (sections, padding, and font sizes) so you can begin the build, or should we refine the "Sample Dossier" copy to ensure it hits the "Executive Briefing" tone perfectly?
