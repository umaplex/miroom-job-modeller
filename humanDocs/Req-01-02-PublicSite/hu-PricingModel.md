This is the "Founder’s Blueprint" for **Job Modeller**. It is designed to scale from your initial **$5K MRR** (100 high-intent users) toward a **$100K MRR** engine by positioning the product not as a "study guide," but as **Strategic Intelligence** for high-stakes career moves1111.

### **I. The Pricing Model: "Intelligence as a Service"**

We move away from generic subscriptions toward **"Intelligence Units" (IUs)** that track the actual value delivered—deep research and interactive persona practice2222.

| Feature | The Gateway (Free) | The Sprint (Tier 1\) | The Season Pass (Tier 2\) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ideal For** | Passive Researchers | "I have an interview next week." | "I am actively hunting (3-5 firms)." |
| **Price Point** | **$0** | **$49 / Month** | **$129 \- $149 (3-Month Access)** |
| **Org Research** | 2 / week (Standard Pillars) | **10 IUs / Month (All Pillars)** | **30 IUs Total (Full Access)** |
| **Data Freshness** | Static (No Refresh) | **20 Refreshes / Month** | **Unlimited Auto-Refresh** |
| **Practice Sessions** | 1 Trial Session | **30 Sessions / Month** | **100 Sessions / Month** |
| **Practice Scope** | Standard Pillars Only | **All 5 Context Pillars** | **All 5 Pillars \+ Competitor Map** |
| **Overages** | N/A | Upgrade to Tier 2 | **$10 / 10-Session Credit Pack** |

**Note on Session Definition:** A "Session" is a single-question thread (Question $\\rightarrow$ User Answer $\\rightarrow$ AI Clarification/Feedback) focused on one specific Pillar, capped at 10 exchanges to maintain contextual precision and manage LLM costs3333.

### **II. Strategic Thinking: The "Job Modeller" Thesis**

Our approach is built on the realization that senior candidates are not rejected for a lack of skill, but for **Strategic Misalignment**4.

#### **1\. The 5-Pillar Context Framework**

Generic tools focus on behavioral performance; we focus on the **5 Pillars of Business Context**5555:

* **Economic Engine:** How the company captures value (e.g., usage-based vs. seat-based SaaS)6666.  
* **Org DNA:** The implicit power structure (e.g., Engineering-led vs. Sales-led)7.  
* **The Burning Platform:** The existential urgency or time-sensitive opportunity driving the hire8.  
* **Domain Lexicon:** The "Tribal Language" used by insiders to signal membership9999.  
* **Decision-Making Framework:** How the organization prioritizes speed, accuracy, or consensus10.

#### **2\. The "Honey Trap" Flywheel**

The Free Tier is our primary acquisition engine. By allowing users to view **Standard Pillars** of existing organizations for free, we build trust in our "Grounded AI" research11111111. Once a candidate realizes they are missing the **Burning Platform** (the "Leaked Exam Paper" insight), the upgrade to Tier 1 becomes a logical "Insurance Policy" for their interview12121212.

#### **3\. Targeting the "Series B Goldilocks Zone"**

We avoid the "Red Ocean" of Big Tech (Google/Meta), where guides are saturated13131313. Instead, we focus on **Series B and High-Growth firms**14. These companies have enough public data (podcasts, blogs, PR) to model effectively but lack mass-market interview prep materials15151515.

### **III. The Strategic Data Moat**

To protect our margins and build a defensible asset, we employ a **"Cache-First, Research-Second"** strategy.

* **Pre-Seeded Catchment Basin:** We manually seed and "Bless" dossiers for the top 100 trending Series B companies16161616. This allows Free Tier users to get instant value with zero marginal LLM cost to us.  
* **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation:** For the first 100 users, we manually verify research and "Bless" top-tier practice questions17171717. This creates a "Gold Standard" library that generic LLMs cannot replicate18181818.  
* **Intelligence Decay (TTL):** Data is not static. **Burning Platform** data is set to decay every 30-90 days19191919. This ensures our intelligence is always perceived as "Insider" and up-to-the-minute20202020.

### **IV. Revenue Strategy: Path to $100K MRR**

1. **Phase 1 (Validation):** Reach **$5,000 MRR** by converting 100 "Mid-Career Operators" (PMs, Staff Engineers) at a **$50 ARPU**21212121.  
2. **Phase 2 (Growth):** Scale the B2C "Season Pass" through niche content marketing (e.g., "The Unofficial Strategy Dossier for PermitFlow")22.  
3. **Phase 3 (Expansion):** Pivot to a **B2B Talent Intelligence** model, selling these dossiers to recruiters who need to prep their candidates to increase placement rates232323232323232323. At **$499/month** per recruiter seat, 200 customers reaches the **$100,000 MRR** goal24.

**Would you like me to draft the "Sales Outreach Template" for recruiters to show them how our dossiers increase their candidate success rate?**
