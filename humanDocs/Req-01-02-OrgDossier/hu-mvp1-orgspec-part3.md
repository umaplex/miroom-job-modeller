The addition of a **General Pillar** is a strategic move to ground the more specialized "8-Pillar Framework" with objective, high-frequency data. This serves as the "Foundational Layer" that informs the intensity and focus of the other pillars.

### **1\. General Pillar: The "Vital Signs" Rubric**

This pillar captures the objective metrics of momentum and talent velocity over the last 24 months.

| Dimension | Data Points to Collect | Insight Implications |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Headcount Velocity** | Total headcount growth % (2-year trend); Departmental skew (e.g., \+40% in Sales vs \+5% in Eng). | Indicates if the company is in "Product/Building" mode or "GTM/Scaling" mode. |
| **Talent Density Shocks** | Notable "Key Hires" at the Director level or above from Tier-1 firms (FAANG, Stripe, OpenAI). | Signals a shift in standards or a preparation for a new growth phase/IPO. |
| **Openings Distribution** | Current active openings; Ratio of Technical vs. Commercial roles; Concentration of "0-to-1" roles vs. "Scale" roles. | Reveals the "Burning Platform"—e.g., a surge in "Security Compliance" roles indicates a move to the Enterprise market. |
| **Leadership Stability** | C-suite tenure; Recent departures of founders or long-term execs. | High executive churn is a "Red Flag" for the candidate to probe during the interview. |

### **2\. Design: Applicability Metadata**

Adding metadata for **Company Size** and **Industry** is highly useful because it allows the "Agentic Workflows" to apply **Pattern Matching**. When specific data is missing for a private company, the AI can lean on "Reasonable Assumptions" based on these values.

#### **Values for Company Size**

* **Seed / Pre-Series A:** Focus on "Founder DNA" and initial PMF signals.  
* **Series A:** Focus on "Early Growth" and hiring the first management layers.  
* **Series B (The "Goldilocks Zone"):** Rapid scaling, transitioning from PMF to "Go-To-Market Fit".  
* **Series C & D:** Preparing for market leadership, international expansion, and operational efficiency.  
* **Series E+ / Pre-IPO:** Preparing for exit; focus on GAAP profitability and public-market readiness.  
* **Public / Enterprise:** Deep historical data available via 10-K filings and earnings calls.

#### **Values for Industry / Vertical**

* **AI-Native / Infrastructure:** Focus on "AI Maturity" and compute-heavy economic engines.  
* **SaaS (B2B / B2C):** Focus on NRR, LTV, and "Seat-based" vs "Usage-based" economics.  
* **FinTech:** Focus on regulatory compliance, unit economics, and "Trust".  
* **Defense & HardTech:** Focus on "Mission Autonomy" and hardware-software integration (e.g., Anduril).  
* **HealthTech:** Focus on "Zero-error" quality and complex multi-stakeholder decision-making.

### **3\. Why this is useful**

These fields are not just labels; they are **Research Constraints**.

1. **Search Strategy:** For a **"Public"** company, the system should prioritize SEC filings and earnings transcripts. For a **"Series B"** company, it must prioritize founder podcasts, TechCrunch "use of proceeds" sections, and Glassdoor trends.  
2. **Simulation Tone:** An interviewer at an **"AI-Native Series A"** company will have a different "Risk Appetite" (experimental/fast) compared to a **"HealthTech Series D"** leader (stability/compliance).  
3. **Revenue Modeling:** Knowing the **"Industry"** allows the AI to correctly guess the likely "Economic Engine"—for example, assuming a usage-based model for modern Cloud Infrastructure vs. a seat-based model for legacy HR SaaS.

**Next Step:** Would you like to define the specific "Economic Engine" rubric questions next, or should we refine how the "General Pillar" data flows into the "Intelligence" class pillars?
