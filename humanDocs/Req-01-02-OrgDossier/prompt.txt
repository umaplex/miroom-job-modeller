hu-mvp1-orgspec-part6-a : The Research Analyst design
hu-mvp1-orgspec-part6-thinkingloud : One way to approach the architecture

Take these as inputs. 
Additionally some comments
I think we  might have evolutions OR A/B testing with Research Analyst. The data model & meta data strfucture is fixed. But I think we should design our research analyst flow keepting A/B in mind
Assume we may change them in future. we should not be changing the code, rather keep these as difrent kinds of Research Analyust
Assume these are different persoans we are implementating and we can change. Ensure the design accomodates taht. and audit data captures that
We can name our Research agents with "Org Analyst"+"XXX" where XXX is a running number 


I want you to perfrom the following
1. Review the content
2. Assess the current imlementation we have
3. Report the following
3a. Do we need any changes to the data model / infrasturecue of what we have doe so far
3b. What is the new / incremental data model needed
3c. What is your view on the provided architecture
3d. Create a high level design & low level design ( including arch diagrams)
4. Present for me to review
