# **Job Modeller: Feasibility Study and Strategic Venture Architecture**

## **1\. Executive Summary: The Thesis for "Consultative Interview Intelligence"**

The premise of "Job Modeller" rests on a fundamental shift in the high-stakes labor market: the commoditization of competence and the rising premium on context. As we analyze the trajectory from a $5,000 monthly revenue MVP to a scalable $100,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR) engine, the core validation exercise focuses on whether a digital platform can replicate the sophisticated research workflows of a management consultant. This report, written from the perspective of a Venture Capital partner evaluating a strategic entry into the Talent Intelligence space, assesses the viability of the "Job Modeller" concept, its 5-Pillar Framework, and its application to Series B technology companies.

The recruitment landscape is currently bifurcated. At one end, generalized AI tools offer superficial behavioral coaching—eye contact correction and generic STAR method structuring—which serves the entry-level market effectively but fails to address the complex needs of senior operators. At the other end, high-touch executive coaching provides deep strategic insight but at a prohibitive cost and low scalability. "Job Modeller" identifies a "Blue Ocean" opportunity between these extremes: utilizing advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic Workflows to deliver "must-have" business intelligence that transforms a job candidate into a strategic consultant during the interview process.

Our feasibility analysis confirms that the proposed "5 Context Pillars"—The Economic Engine, Organizational DNA, The Burning Platform, The Domain Lexicon, and The Decision-Making Framework—align perfectly with advanced sales methodologies like The Challenger Sale and SPIN Selling, which are the de facto operating modes for successful senior interviews. By equipping candidates with the "burning platform" context of a Series B company—such as Alembic’s need to deploy $145 million to prove causal AI efficacy or PermitFlow’s urgency to solve the housing crisis via automated permitting—the product enables candidates to bypass the "competence check" and engage in "strategic alignment."

However, technical due diligence reveals significant challenges. While financial data is retrievable, extracting "Organizational DNA" and implicit cultural values via Large Language Models (LLMs) is prone to hallucination and bias, requiring a sophisticated multi-agent architecture rather than a simple wrapper. Financially, the $149 "Season Pass" model is robust, positioned strategically as a transaction cost for a high-value career move, rather than a subscription. To scale to $100,000 MRR, the venture must eventually pivot from a pure B2C play to a B2B "Talent Intelligence" platform, selling the same proprietary insights to recruiters and hiring managers who are equally starved for verified candidate-company fit data.

## **2\. Market Landscape and Competitive Dynamics**

The strategic positioning of Job Modeller depends heavily on understanding why current solutions fail the target demographic: senior candidates interviewing at high-growth Series B startups. The market is saturated with tools that solve the wrong problem for this segment.

### **2.1 The Commoditization of "Behavioral" Prep**

The explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a proliferation of "AI Interview Copilots." Platforms like Final Round AI 1, Yoodli 2, and Interviewing.ai 3 have democratized access to basic interview coaching. These tools excel at the performative aspects of interviewing. They analyze speech patterns, reduce filler words, and generate real-time transcriptions to prompt candidates with generic answers. Final Round AI, for instance, offers an "Interview CoPilot" that provides real-time transcription and "smart prompts".1 Similarly, Yoodli focuses on communication skills, offering AI roleplays for "difficult conversations".2

While impressive, these tools address "Level 1" problems: clarity, confidence, and basic formatting. For a Product Manager interviewing at a Series B fintech, having good eye contact is necessary but insufficient. If the candidate speaks clearly but fails to understand that the company’s recent pivot to usage-based pricing 4 threatens their churn metrics, they will fail. The existing AI tools are "Context-Blind." They operate on the text of the job description and the user's resume, missing the vast, invisible ocean of company strategy, market pressure, and investor expectations that actually drive hiring decisions. "Job Modeller" differentiates itself by treating the interview not as a performance, but as a strategic consultation.

### **2.2 The Limitations of Human Expert Networks**

The primary alternative to AI tools is human coaching. Platforms like Interviewing.io 5, Exponent 7, and Carrus 8 have built marketplaces connecting candidates with hiring managers from top-tier tech firms (FAANG/MAMAA).

* **The "Big Tech" Bias:** These platforms are optimized for standardized hiring loops at Google, Meta, and Amazon. Exponent offers detailed guides for these giants 9, and Interviewing.io offers anonymous mock interviews with their engineers.10  
* **The Series B Gap:** A candidate interviewing at **Alembic** (a Series B marketing analytics firm) or **Nexl** (a Series B legal CRM) will not find a mentor on these platforms who understands the specific nuances of those companies. A Google engineer cannot simulate the "scrappy, sales-led" culture of a Series B startup trying to find product-market fit in the legal vertical.  
* **Economic Inefficiency:** The cost structure of human coaching is prohibitive for continuous practice. Executive coaching packages often start at $500 and can run into thousands 11, or charge per-session rates of $150-$300.13

This analysis validates the "Job Modeller" pricing strategy. At $149 for a Season Pass, the product offers a compelling value proposition: it provides the *specificity* of a human mentor (by mining deep data) at the *scalability* and *price point* closer to software. It fills the vacuum where high-stakes, specific company knowledge is required but unavailable through mentorship networks.

### **2.3 The "Strategic Alignment" Crisis**

Research into hiring failures at the senior level reveals a recurring theme: "Strategic Misalignment".14 Senior candidates are rarely rejected because they cannot code or build a roadmap; they are rejected because their approach does not align with the company's current phase of growth or its unwritten "Organizational DNA."

Candidates often complain about the "lack of business context" in interviews.15 They are asked to solve abstract problems without knowing the constraints. Conversely, companies complain that candidates do not understand the "burning platform"—the existential threats driving the business.16 For example, hiring managers at high-growth startups often reject candidates who focus on "process" when the company needs "speed," or vice versa. The "Job Modeller" solves this by engaging the candidate in the *company's* reality before they walk into the room.

### **2.4 Competitive Feature Matrix**

## **3\. Product Architecture: The 5 Context Pillars**

The user's proposed "5 Context Pillars" are not merely distinct categories of information; they represent a translation layer that converts raw corporate data into an "Interview Strategy." This framework effectively productizes the due diligence process of a Venture Capitalist or the discovery phase of a Management Consultant. To validate these pillars, we must map them to the specific information deficits that cause candidates to fail.

### **3.1 Pillar I: The Economic Engine**

* **Definition:** This pillar encompasses the company's revenue model, unit economics, pricing strategy, and the financial levers that drive growth. It answers the question: "How does this business actually capture value?"  
* **Why It Is "Must-Have":** Candidates frequently misunderstand the financial imperatives of the role. For instance, a Product Manager interviewing at a SaaS company moving from "Seat-Based" to "Usage-Based" pricing faces a completely different set of incentives and metrics (e.g., optimizing for consumption vs. optimizing for license retention).  
* **Validation via AirOps Case Study:** Research into **AirOps**, a Series A/B content operations platform, reveals a nuanced pricing model. While they offer a standard subscription ($199/month), their growth is driven by *usage overages* ($9 per 1,000 tasks).4 A candidate who proposes a roadmap focused solely on "user acquisition" might miss the more lucrative lever of "task intensity." The "Job Modeller" would extract this pricing detail and prompt the candidate: *"AirOps monetizes on task volume. Ask the interviewer: 'How does the current usage-based pricing model influence the prioritization of high-frequency automation features versus low-frequency strategic tools?'"* This demonstrates deep commercial awareness.17  
* **Data Extraction Feasibility:** High. Pricing pages, Terms of Service, and investor presentations are publicly available and structured.

### **3.2 Pillar II: Organizational DNA**

* **Definition:** The implicit operating system of the company. This includes the "unwritten rules," the power center (e.g., Engineering-led vs. Sales-led), and the core values that are actually practiced rather than just preached.  
* **Why It Is "Must-Have":** Cultural mismatch is the leading cause of rejection for qualified candidates. Series B companies often have distinct, strong cultures formed by the founders.  
* **Validation via Nexl Case Study:** **Nexl**, a legal CRM provider, operates with a specific philosophy of "Revenue Operations" (RevOps) that attempts to break down silos between marketing and legal practitioners.18 Their DNA is also heavily "Remote-First," with a specific emphasis on integrity and empathy.19 A candidate who frames their experience in terms of "command and control" management would be rejected. The "Job Modeller" must surface this DNA, warning the candidate: *"Nexl values autonomous execution within a remote framework. Frame your management style as 'outcome-oriented' rather than 'process-oriented'."*  
* **Data Extraction Feasibility:** Moderate to Low. This requires synthesizing qualitative data from podcast transcripts 20, employee reviews, and founder blog posts. It is susceptible to "corporate speak" contamination, requiring advanced filtering.

### **3.3 Pillar III: The Burning Platform**

* **Definition:** The existential threat or the massive, time-sensitive opportunity that is driving the immediate hiring need. This is the "Why Now?" of the interview.  
* **Why It Is "Must-Have":** In the consultative sales model (The Challenger Sale), this is known as the "Reframing" moment.16 The candidate must show they understand the pain the company is in.  
* **Validation via PermitFlow Case Study:** **PermitFlow** recently raised a $54 million Series B led by Accel.21 The capital is deployed to solve a specific "Burning Platform": the national housing crisis compounded by bureaucratic permitting delays. The company is racing to deploy AI agents to automate this workflow before competitors or regulatory changes close the window. A candidate must articulate their value in terms of *speed* and *automation accuracy*. The Job Modeller would generate a briefing: *"PermitFlow is in a race to define the category of 'construction workflow automation.' Your goal is to show how you can accelerate their roadmap to capture market share immediately post-funding."*  
* **Data Extraction Feasibility:** High. Funding announcements 22, press releases, and industry news coverage provide clear signals on the "use of funds."

### **3.4 Pillar IV: The Domain Lexicon & Persona**

* **Definition:** The specific vocabulary, acronyms, and mental models used by insiders in the industry. Using the right words signals "tribal membership."  
* **Why It Is "Must-Have":** Every industry has shibboleths—words that identify you as an insider. In LegalTech, you don't say "customer," you say "client" or "fee-earner".23 In Data Infrastructure, you speak of "Data Lakes" and "Atomic Commits".24  
* **Validation via LakeFS Case Study:** **LakeFS** operates in the complex domain of data versioning. Their lexicon borrows heavily from Git ("Branch," "Commit," "Merge") applied to Data Lakes.25 A candidate who mistakenly uses data warehouse terminology (like "Table Schema" exclusively) instead of "Object Storage" terminology risks looking outdated. The Job Modeller creates a "Glossary" for the candidate, ensuring they speak the language of the "Data Engineering" persona.  
* **Data Extraction Feasibility:** Moderate. Technical documentation 26, API docs 27, and whitepapers 28 are rich sources of lexicon.

### **3.5 Pillar V: The Decision-Making Framework**

* **Definition:** How the organization processes information and makes choices. Is it data-driven or heuristic? Is it consensus-based or top-down? Do they value "perfect" code or "shipping fast"?  
* **Why It Is "Must-Have":** This dictates how a candidate should explain their past decisions. If a company values "Move Fast and Break Things," a story about a 6-month meticulous planning phase will be fatal.  
* **Validation via Alembic Case Study:** **Alembic** focuses on "Causal AI" for marketing attribution.29 Their decision-making framework is rigorously scientific, seeking to prove *causality* rather than just correlation. CEO Tomás Puig’s background and the company’s messaging suggest a culture that values deep, proprietary data over generic models.30 The Job Modeller must advise the candidate: *"Alembic’s leadership values mathematical certainty and proprietary data moats. When discussing past projects, emphasize the 'Why' and the data validation steps you took, not just the outcome."*  
* **Data Extraction Feasibility:** Low (Hardest). This often requires inferring the framework from the leadership’s background and technical blog posts detailing *how* they solved past engineering challenges.31

## **4\. Target Market Analysis: The Series B Opportunity**

The user provided examples of Stripe, Zillow, and Palantir. While these are excellent benchmarks for "high-bar" cultures, they are not the ideal initial target market for "Job Modeller." They are **Red Oceans**—saturated with existing interview guides.9 The strategic "Blue Ocean" lies in the **Series B** market.

### **4.1 Why Series B is the "Sweet Spot"**

1. **Information Asymmetry:** Public companies (Series D+/IPO) like Palantir have thousands of Glassdoor reviews and dedicated Exponent courses. Seed-stage companies have too little public data to model. Series B companies (raising $20M-$50M) are in the "Goldilocks Zone": they have a digital footprint (podcasts, blogs, PR) but lack mass-market interview guides.  
2. **High Stakes:** Series B roles often come with significant equity upside. The "Season Pass" price of $149 is negligible compared to the potential value of a 0.1% equity grant in a future unicorn.  
3. **Hiring Velocity:** Series B implies a fresh injection of capital explicitly designated for hiring. Companies like **PermitFlow** ($54M raise) and **Alembic** ($145M raise) are actively scaling their teams, creating a concentrated demand for talent.  
4. **Strategic Flux:** Series B is often where the "Burning Platform" is hottest. The company is transitioning from "Product-Market Fit" to "Go-to-Market Fit." This transition creates the complex, strategic interview questions that "Job Modeller" is designed to answer.

### **4.2 The "Consultant" Candidate Persona**

The target user for Job Modeller is not an entry-level graduate. It is the "Mid-Career Operator"—a Product Manager, Engineering Lead, or Sales Director with 5-10 years of experience.

* **Pain Point:** They have the skills but lack the time to do 20 hours of research per company.  
* **Goal:** They want to walk into the interview and sound like they have been working there for a month.  
* **Budget:** They are accustomed to paying for professional tools. They are likely currently employed and looking for a strategic jump, making them less price-sensitive than unemployed new grads.

## **5\. Simulated Output: The "Job Modeller" Dossiers**

To prove feasibility, we must simulate the output of the "Job Context Engine" for specific Series B companies found in the research. This demonstrates exactly what the user receives for their $149.

### **5.1 Dossier A: Alembic (Marketing Intelligence)**

* **The Burning Platform:** Alembic recently raised $145M 32 to prove that "Proprietary Data is the New Moat".30 They are fighting against the "cookie deprecation" crisis in marketing. The urgency is to deploy this capital to capture enterprise clients before legacy attribution models adapt.  
* **Economic Engine:** Enterprise B2B SaaS. They sell "Causal AI" solutions to CMOs and CFOs. The value prop is "Justifying Marketing Spend" to the CFO.33  
  * *Interview Tip:* "Frame your past marketing projects not in terms of 'brand awareness' (soft metric) but 'revenue causality' (hard metric). Ask about their sales cycle length for Fortune 500 clients."  
* **Org DNA:** "Truth-Seeking." The CEO emphasizes that "most companies are short on answers".34 The culture values rigorous data validation over intuition.  
* **Lexicon:** "Causal AI," "Marketing Tapestry," "Time-Series Data," "Proprietary Data Moat".35

### **5.2 Dossier B: PermitFlow (Construction Tech)**

* **The Burning Platform:** The U.S. housing shortage and high interest rates mean developers are bleeding money every day a permit is delayed. PermitFlow raised $54M to solve this "administrative friction".21  
* **Economic Engine:** Likely moving from transactional (per permit) to platform subscription (SaaS) for large developers like Lennar and Toll Brothers.  
  * *Interview Tip:* "Ask about the 'Land and Expand' strategy. Do they start with one region's permits and expand to the developer's national portfolio?"  
* **Decision Framework:** Speed and pragmatic automation. As a YC alum 36, they value iteration. However, dealing with government entities requires 100% accuracy.  
  * *Interview Tip:* "Discuss how you balance 'move fast' with 'compliance risk' in your product decisions."

### **5.3 Dossier C: Nexl (Legal Tech)**

* **The Burning Platform:** Law firms are facing pressure to modernize, but lawyers hate data entry. Nexl's existence is based on the "Passive Data Capture" thesis—CRM without the work.23  
* **Org DNA:** "Revenue Operations" (RevOps) is their religion. They believe in unifying BD, Marketing, and Legal.18 They are also a "Remote-First" company with a focus on empathy.19  
* **Lexicon:** "Fee-earner," "Passive Data Capture," "Relationship Intelligence," "Who Knows Who".23

These dossiers represent the "Must-Have" intelligence. A candidate armed with this briefing can ask questions that stop the interviewer in their tracks.

## **6\. Technical Architecture and Feasibility**

Building the "Job Context Engine" is the primary technical risk. The system must ingest unstructured data (news, blogs, transcripts) and output structured "Pillars" without hallucinating.

### **6.1 The Data Ingestion Pipeline (RAG Architecture)**

The architecture must go beyond simple web scraping. It requires a multi-agent system utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.

1. **Agent 1: The "News Hunter" (Tavily API):**  
   * **Function:** Queries the web for recent news, funding announcements, and press releases.  
   * **Feasibility:** Tavily is optimized for AI agents, allowing for accurate retrieval of "Burning Platform" data (e.g., Series B funding amounts, lead investors).37  
2. **Agent 2: The "Deep Diver" (Perplexity API):**  
   * **Function:** Answers complex conceptual questions. "What is Alembic's pricing model?" "What is the engineering culture at LakeFS?"  
   * **Feasibility:** Perplexity's API provides citations, allowing the system to verify claims.39 This is crucial for reducing hallucinations.  
3. **Agent 3: The "Asset Scraper" (Custom Python):**  
   * **Function:** Targets specific high-value URLs: company.com/pricing, company.com/blog, company.com/careers.  
   * **Feasibility:** Standard scraping libraries (BeautifulSoup/Selenium) can extract text from these pages to populate the "Lexicon" and "Economic Engine" pillars.

### **6.2 The Hallucination Problem & Mitigation**

Research indicates that RAG systems can hallucinate up to 10-20% of the time, especially on non-factual or "implicit" queries like culture.40

* **The Risk:** If the model invents a "Sales-led" culture for a strictly "Product-led" company, the candidate will fail.  
* **Mitigation Strategy 1: "Citation-Backed" Generation.** The system must be instructed to *only* generate insights it can cite. If it cannot find a source for the "Decision Framework," it must state "Insufficient Data" rather than guessing.  
* **Mitigation Strategy 2: The "Critic" Agent.** Implement a second LLM agent whose sole job is to fact-check the output of the first agent against the retrieved documents.42  
* **Mitigation Strategy 3: Benchmarking.** Utilize frameworks like "HHEM" (Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model) to score the reliability of generated dossiers.43

### **6.3 Challenges in "Implicit Value" Extraction**

Extracting "Organizational DNA" (implicit values) is the hardest technical challenge. Academic research suggests that LLMs struggle to infer implicit cultural values from text without significant fine-tuning or "Chain of Thought" prompting.44

* **Implication:** The MVP should rely on *explicit* cultural signals (e.g., "We are a remote-first company" stated on the careers page) rather than trying to infer subtle cultural nuances from blog tone. As the dataset grows, the model can be fine-tuned on "Series B Cultural Archetypes" to improve inference.

## **7\. Go-to-Market and Pricing Strategy**

### **7.1 Pricing Strategy: The $149 "Season Pass"**

The proposed $149 pricing is validated by the competitive landscape.

* **Anchor Points:**  
  * **Low End:** Generic AI tools ($20-$50/month) \-\> Too cheap to be trusted for high-stakes outcomes.  
  * **High End:** Executive Coaching ($300-$1000+) \-\> Too expensive for most.  
* **The "Season Pass" Psychology:** Job hunting is episodic. A candidate does not need a "subscription" for 12 months. They need intense support for 3 months. The $149 "Season Pass" (valid for 3-6 months) aligns with the user's lifecycle. It is positioned as a **transaction cost** for the "deal" of getting a new job.  
* **Revenue Math:**  
  * Target Year 1 MRR: $5,000 \- $10,000.  
  * Sales Required: \~35 \- 70 passes per month.  
  * Traffic Required: At a 1.5% conversion rate, this requires \~2,500 \- 5,000 unique visitors/month. This is achievable through niche content marketing (e.g., "The Unofficial Guide to the PermitFlow Interview").

### **7.2 Scaling from $5k to $100k: The B2B Pivot**

To scale to $100k/month ($1.2M ARR), the "Season Pass" model faces a churn problem: successful customers leave. To reach the next level, "Job Modeller" must pivot to B2B.

* **Target:** Independent Recruiters and Boutique Search Firms.  
* **Value Prop:** Recruiters are paid on placement (contingency). If their candidate fails the interview, they earn $0.  
* **The Offer:** "Talent Intelligence Subscription." Sell the "Dossiers" to recruiters to prep *their* candidates.  
* **Economics:** $499/month per recruiter seat for unlimited dossiers.  
  * 200 Recruiters \= $100,000 MRR.  
  * This is far more scalable than finding 700 individual candidates every month.

## **8\. The 10-Day MVP Roadmap**

The user proposed a 10-Day MVP plan. We have refined this based on the technical research to focus on the highest-value components.

### **Days 1-3: The Data Ingestion Engine (The "Scout")**

* **Goal:** Build the RAG pipeline using Tavily and Perplexity APIs.  
* **Task:** Create a script that takes a Company URL and outputs a raw text file containing: Funding History, Recent News, Pricing Page text, and "About Us" text.  
* **Key Validation:** Ensure the "Burning Platform" data (funding) is accurate for the test companies (Alembic, PermitFlow).

### **Days 4-6: The Context Engine (The "Synthesizer")**

* **Goal:** Prompt Engineering for the 5 Pillars.  
* **Task:** Design the system prompts (Context Profiles) for the LLM.  
  * *Input:* Raw text from Days 1-3.  
  * *Instruction:* "Act as a Management Consultant. Analyze this data to extract the 'Economic Engine'. Cite your sources."  
  * *Output:* A structured JSON object with the 5 Pillars.  
* **Critical Step:** Implement the "Context Profile" injector 46 to ensure the LLM adopts the specific persona of the hiring manager (e.g., "Sales Leader" vs. "Engineering Manager").

### **Days 7-9: The "Dossier" Generator (The Product)**

* **Goal:** The User Interface (Output).  
* **Task:** Instead of a complex "Simulator," build a **High-Fidelity PDF/Web Report Generator.** The user enters a URL, waits 2 minutes, and gets a "Strategic Dossier."  
* **Refinement:** The user requested an "Interactive Q\&A." Build this as a simple text-based chat interface *on top* of the Dossier. "Chat with this Company's Persona."  
  * *Feature:* "Challenge Me." The AI asks a hard strategic question based on the "Burning Platform."

### **Day 10: Launch & Alpha Test**

* **Task:** Release the tool to a small cohort (10-20 users).  
* **Target:** Friends or network connections interviewing at Series B firms.  
* **Metric:** "Wow" Factor. Do they say, "I didn't know this about the company"?

## **9\. Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

| Risk Category | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Technical** | **Hallucination:** The AI invents facts about a company's strategy. | **Strict RAG Citations:** The UI must show *where* the info came from (e.g., "Source: TechCrunch Article, Dec 2025"). Implement a "Confidence Score" for each pillar. |
| **Market** | **Low Willingness to Pay:** Candidates rely on free tools (ChatGPT). | **Differentiation:** Market the "Proprietary Data." ChatGPT cannot browse deep specifically for "Series B Burning Platforms" without complex prompting. |
| **Legal** | **Scraping Restrictions:** Companies blocking scrapers. | **Use API Aggregators:** Rely on Tavily/Perplexity which handle the scraping complexity and compliance. |
| **Operational** | **Data Staleness:** Insights become outdated quickly. | **Real-Time Refresh:** The "Burning Platform" agent must re-run every time a dossier is requested. |

## **10\. Strategic Recommendations & Conclusion**

### **10.1 Strategic Pivot: From "Prep" to "Consulting"**

The most critical recommendation is a branding shift. Do not use the word "Prep." "Prep" implies remediation—fixing a weakness. Use the word **"Intelligence."** This implies an advantage—gaining a weapon.

* *Old Pitch:* "Practice your interview answers."  
* *New Pitch:* "Download the Insider Strategy Dossier. Walk in like a Consultant."

### **10.2 The "Must-Have" Feature: The Competitor Map**

To truly move to "must-have" status, the product needs to provide **Competitive Intelligence**.

* **Feature:** "The Enemy Line."  
* **Function:** When generating a dossier for **PermitFlow**, the system should also scan **Procore** and **PlanGrid**.  
* **Insight:** "PermitFlow is disrupting Procore's marketplace. In your interview, position yourself as a specialist (PermitFlow) vs. a generalist (Procore)." This is the kind of insight that wins offers.

### **10.3 Conclusion**

The "Job Modeller" venture is fundamentally sound. The "Series B" market focus provides a defensible niche, the "5 Context Pillars" provide the necessary theoretical rigor, and the Agentic RAG architecture makes the data extraction feasible. The financial goal of $10k MRR in Year 1 is achievable with just \~70 monthly customers, a low bar for a global digital product.

The path to $100k lies in proving the value to candidates first, then pivoting to sell that same "Intelligence Engine" to the recruiters who hold the keys to the kingdom. Proceed with the 10-Day MVP, focusing relentlessly on data accuracy and the "Consultant" user experience.

### **Supporting Data: Series B "Burning Platform" Examples**

| Company | "Burning Platform" (The Pain) | "Economic Engine" (The Value) | "Lexicon" (The Language) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Alembic** | **Justify Valuation:** Raised $145M.32 Needs to prove "Causal AI" works for Enterprise. | **ROI Proof:** Selling "Causality" to CFOs, not just "Attribution" to CMOs.29 | *Causal AI, Marketing Tapestry, Time-Series* |
| **PermitFlow** | **Housing Crisis:** Speed to market for developers blocked by bureaucracy.21 | **SaaS Transition:** Moving from transactional fees to enterprise subscriptions.47 | *Entitlements, Municipal Code, Plan Check* |
| **Nexl** | **Adoption Fatigue:** Lawyers hate CRMs. Needs "Passive" adoption.23 | **RevOps:** Unifying BD and Legal. Selling "Relationship Intelligence".18 | *Fee-Earner, Passive Capture, Rainmaker* |

This table represents the "Gold Standard" output for the MVP. If the Job Modeller can generate this table automatically for any URL, the product is a success.
