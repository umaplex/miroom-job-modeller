# Functional Specification: Job Modeller MVP 1 (Org Intelligence)

**Goal:** Deliver the "Golden Standard" Org Dossier. Replace the mock/placeholder logic from MVP 0 with actual Agentic Research (Tavily/Perplexity).

## 1. The Context Engine (Backend)
**Requirements:**
*   **Input:** Company Domain (e.g., `alembic.com`).
*   **Workflow (LangGraph):**
    1.  **News Hunter Agent:** Search for "Funding", "Revenue Model", "CEO Interviews".
    2.  **Scraper Agent:** Scrape `domain.com/about`, `domain.com/careers`.
    3.  **Synthesis Agent:** Map findings to the **5 Context Pillars JSON Schema**.
*   **Output:** Structured JSON object stored in `org_pillars` table.

## 2. The 5 Pillars JSON Schema
**Structure:**
```json
{
  "economic_engine": {
    "model_type": "SaaS | Marketplace | Usage-Based",
    "key_metric": "NRR | GMV | Consumption",
    "insight": "...",
    "source_url": "...",
    "confidence_score": 0.9
  },
  "org_dna": {
    "primary_dept": "Engineering | Sales | Product",
    "cultural_values": ["Truth-Seeking", "Remote-First"],
    "insight": "...",
    "source_url": "...",
    "confidence_score": 0.6
  },
  ...
}
```

## 3. The "Theatrical" UI (Enhanced)
**Requirements:**
*   **Live "Hits":** Instead of generic logs, stream *actual* findings.
    *   *Display:* "FOUND: TechCrunch Article 'Alembic raises $14M'..."
    *   *Visual:* Small "Success" checks appearing next to each Pillar icon in the sidebar as data is found.
*   **Confidence Indicators:** If data is missing (e.g., no "Culture" blog found), show "Inferring from Sector Benchmarks..." (to indicate Synthetic Data).

## 4. The Executive Briefing (Dossier View)
**Requirements:**
*   **Layout:** 1-Page "Cheat Sheet" style. High contrast, easy to read in 5 minutes.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Pillar Cards:** 5 distinct sections with Icons.
    *   **"The Hidden Narrative":** A top-level summary generated by the LLM (e.g., "They say they want X, but financially they need Y").
    *   **Source Citations:** Footnotes or tooltips linking to the source URL (building trust).
    *   **"Copy to Clipboard":** For users to take notes.

## 5. The "Practice Map" (Job-less Mode)
**Requirements:**
*   **Global Search:** Users can search for existing Org Dossiers (e.g., "Stripe", "Netflix") without providing a JD.
*   **Waitlist Logic:** If a user searches for a missing company, add to "Requested" list. Show "3 other users requested this."

## 6. Admin Tools (HITL)
**Requirements:**
*   **Dossier Editor:** Admin can view the generated JSON and manually edit/override fields.
*   **"Bless" Button:** Mark a specific version of the Dossier as "Gold Standard" (preventing auto-overwrite).
*   **Refresh Trigger:** Admin can force a re-crawl of a specific company.

## MVP 1 Success Criteria
*   [ ] System successfully scrapes legitimate data for a target test company (e.g., Alembic).
*   [ ] LLM correctly categorizes data into the 5 Pillars.
*   [ ] UI accurately reflects "Source vs. Inference."
*   [ ] Users can view a "High Value" Dossier that feels like insider info.
